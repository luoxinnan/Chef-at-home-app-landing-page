<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This app-loading webpage is created using <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, with the brand and content being original work. The page is designed by me and written from scratch as a testament to completing a self-learning stage in web development, specifically in mastering Bootstrap. </p>
<p>Note that the webpage has interactive elements like buttons and a contact form, but doesn't have functions written by JavaScript.</p>
